# Assignment One: Big O Notation

## This program demonstrates an understanding of Big O notation in the form of constant time (O(1)), linear time (O(n)), and quadratic time (O(n^2)).

constant time
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

linear time
describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(n2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.
