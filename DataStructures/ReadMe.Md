# DataStructures

This program shows how to get, store, and access data using Arrays, Maps(hashtables), stacks and queue 
methods. each does similar things which is taking information and add data but each one does so differently.

## Arrays
Arrays are ordered and take up less memory but are fixed size. so best used when data is small and wont
be altered much.

## Maps
Maps(Hashtable) take up more memory but are much faster.best used when data will be changed often.

## Stacks and Queues
stacks and queues are a different way of access data. either First in First out like Stacks or
Last In Last out such as queues. depends on the user nad programmer.
